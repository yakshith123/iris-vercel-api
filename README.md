CI/CD and Automated Tests ðŸ”¹
This project includes Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices to demonstrate production readiness.

âœ… Continuous Integration (Github Actions):

A Github Action pipeline is configured in [.github/workflows/python-app.yml].

This pipeline performs the following:

Sets up the appropriate Python environment.

Installs the projectâ€™s dependencies.

Executes automated tests (with pytest) to validate functionality.

âœ… Automated Tests:

We have a test script test_app.py that validates API functionality by sending a request to the API and verifying the response.

This guarantees code quality and prevents regressions.

ðŸ”¹ How to Run Tests Locally ðŸ”¹
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest

âœ… All tests should pass with a green output.

ðŸ”¹ How CI Works ðŸ”¹
Every new push or pull request to main:

Github Actions runs:

Installs dependencies.

Performs automated tests.

If all checks pass, the code is ready for deployment (Heroku, Render, or another platform).
